Descriptions of each page

On the first page it shows different houses that my real estate business has contructed. I used a parralex and carousel. Then I talk about what Jubilee housing is. The second page is about different photos of 100% completed homes and fully built in Accra Ghana. The third page talks about what different listings available of houses and the locations of the houses. 

How did using Bootstrap change your programming experience?

Bootstrap changed my programming experience because at first I thought I would have to code out and memorize all the components like a carousel, card and more. But with bootstrap I can simply copy and paste the bootstrap template of whatever component I want to use to replit then edit the rest. 

How closely were you able to follow your MVP plan? Why or why not?
I was able to follow my mvp plan pretty closely because I knew what things i needed to do to be done everyday and my teachers also helped me reach the goals I wanted everyday.
What features are you the most proud of?

The feature i was most proud most of adding is the parralex because I really wanted to add something like that and i got inspiration from Peace 

What would you add if you had more time?

I would prolly a page about the developer.
